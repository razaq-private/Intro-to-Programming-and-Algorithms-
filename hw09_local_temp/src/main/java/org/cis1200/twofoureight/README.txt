Hi this is my attempt at 2048. The game works by the person moving the arrow keys in order to move the tiles in
a certain direction. For instance, if they moved the tiles up, they would need to press the up arrow on the keyboard.
The concepts that were in this game were, 2D array, Collections, File I/O and JUnit testing.
I attempted to get the File I/O to save and load the game, but the game is only able to save.
For the collections, I used it to implement an undo button that will allow the user to return to the previous move.
Each of the tiles also carry a different color.
